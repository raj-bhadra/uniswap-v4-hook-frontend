## Core Functionality

### Encryption Utilities

The project includes main functions in `src/utils/inco-lite.ts` i.e encryptValue and reencryptValue:

#### 1. encryptValue

Encrypts a numeric value for a specific contract and address:

```typescript
const encryptedData = await encryptValue({
  value: BigInt("1000"), // Value to encrypt
  address: "0x...", // User's wallet address
  contractAddress: "0x...", // Contract address
});
```

#### 2. reEncryptValue

Re-encrypts a value using a wallet client and handle:

```typescript
const decryptedValue = await reEncryptValue({
  walletClient: yourWalletClient,
  handle: "0x...", // Encryption handle
});
```
